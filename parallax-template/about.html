            <p>Dubai College is so much more than the leading academic school in Dubai, it is a community of excellence at the heart of the city. Our students do have a long track record of excelling academically and in a recent survey of top international schools taking British exams we were identified as the number one British school overseas in the world. However, our enviable reputation stems from our consistent and sustained excellence in what we see as the four foundations of the College: sporting, creative, philanthropic as well as academic endeavour. We champion this broader holistic education in the great tradition of the British independent schools which recognize that by producing socially articulate and well-rounded students we are preparing them for their future far better than any exam ever will. We are now the school of choice for parents who are well established within Dubai and the majority of families who choose the College are those who have lived and worked in the emirate for well over a decade. The reassuring sense of history and depth of institutional memory, which pervade the College, give the school a welcome stability within the Dubai educational landscape. When families join Dubai College they become lifelong members of an institution, which puts the child at the centre of everything. Our not-for-profit status means that every dirham we charge is reinvested in the students and the school. The high quality teaching and excellent extra-curricular provision make Dubai College a very special place to be and we hope you can see why the College has earned itself an outstanding reputation over the course of the past 38 years. Please do not just take my word for it, however, come and visit the College for yourself. You will be most welcome. </p>
